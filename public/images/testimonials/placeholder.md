# Placeholder Images

This file is a reminder to replace these placeholders with actual testimonial images.

For now, the placeholder files are 1x1 transparent pixels to avoid errors in the development environment.

When actual testimonial images are available, please update them following the guidelines in the README.md file.

Ensure images represent diverse individuals from different backgrounds, genders, and programs.
