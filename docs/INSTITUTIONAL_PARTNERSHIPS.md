# Institutional Partnerships Component

## Overview
The Institutional Partnerships component is a key trust-building element for the SKILL BRIDGE website. It showcases our partnerships with educational institutions across tier-2 and tier-3 cities in India, highlighting how these collaborations enhance the learning experience through local infrastructure and community support.

## Component Structure

### 1. Partner Showcase
Displays partner institution logos, locations, and available facilities. Each partner is presented in a card format with:
- Institution name
- Location with pin icon
- List of key facilities available to students
- Visual representation of the campus or facilities

### 2. Hybrid Learning Model Visualization
Explains the hybrid learning approach using a visual representation that shows:
- Online learning components (self-paced modules, live sessions)
- Campus-based components (hands-on workshops, peer collaboration)
- How these elements connect to create a seamless learning experience

### 3. Student Benefits Section
Highlights the advantages students gain from these institutional partnerships:
- Access to physical infrastructure (labs, high-speed internet)
- Local learning community for peer support
- Faculty engagement and additional mentorship
- Local industry connections and networking opportunities

## Design Elements

The component follows the site's established design language:
- Gold gradient accents and highlights
